# SQL-Data-Warehouse-project
Creating a modern data warehouse using SQL Server with a focus on ETL, data modeling, and analytics.

📌 Project Overview
🏗️ Building the Data Warehouse

Objective:
I built a modern data warehouse in SQL Server to bring together sales data and support better reporting and data-driven decisions.

What I Did:

Data Sources: Brought in data from two systems (ERP + CRM), provided as CSV files.

Data Cleaning: Cleaned up the data and fixed quality issues before diving into analysis.

Integration: Combined both sources into a single, easy-to-use model designed for fast, analytical queries.

Scope: Focused only on the most recent data — no need for historical storage.

Docs: Wrote clear documentation to help both business users and the analytics team understand and use the model.

📊 BI: Analytics & Reporting
Objective:
I created SQL-based analytics to deliver insights into:

👥 Customer behavior

📦 Product performance

📈 Sales trends
